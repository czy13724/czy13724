🚨 **Impersonation Alert** 🚨  

⚠️ **Beware of impersonators and stay safe!** ⚠️  

1️⃣ **This bot is for message relaying only**  
👉 This bot is only used to relay messages. Any private messages, transactions, or requests for personal information in my name are **not from me**!  

2️⃣ **Watch out for impersonators**  
👉 Scammers may copy my profile picture, username, or even fake chat history to deceive you. Always verify before trusting any claims.  

3️⃣ **I will never message you first**  
👉 If someone privately messages you claiming to be me—especially asking for money, verification codes, investment opportunities, or account recovery—it’s a scam! Ignore and report them.  

4️⃣ **Report impersonators immediately!**  
👉 On Telegram, tap and hold the scammer’s profile → Select “Report” → Choose “Fake account” or “Scam.”  

📢 **Stay alert and protect yourself from fraud!** 📢
